            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Katy, Texas, has shaped who I am. From early childhood memories to adventures around town, I've always felt a connection to this place. This website I created is a glimpse into my journey that made me who I am today, including my lifelong childhood friendship and my passion for travel.</p>

            <h2>Childhood Friendship</h2>
            <p>My childhood best friend and I knew each other since the beginning of elementary school. He was from London and eventually his family and him had to move back to London, and we ended up losing contact for years, but eventually his mom emailed my mom asking if I wanted to come to London to spend time with him for a week.</p>
